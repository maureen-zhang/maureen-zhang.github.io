   == Final Project ==
<br><br>
The final project should be completed in groups of 2-3 students. It is a great opportunity to apply the techniques you have learned in class to a real-world dataset. 
    <br>
    <p>- Project objectives -</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prepare your selected dataset.</li>
        <li>Apply appropriate supervised learning techniques.</li>
        <li>Optionally, apply advanced techniques such as Deep Learning or Decision Trees.</li>
        <li>Perform model evaluation and interpret the results.</li>
        <li>Present your findings in a clear and organized report.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>- Dataset selection -</p>
    <p>Choose a dataset from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php" target="_blank">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.</p>
    <p>Some recommended datasets to consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris" target="_blank">Iris</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine" target="_blank">Wine</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult" target="_blank">Adult (Census Income)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease" target="_blank">Heart Disease</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing" target="_blank">Bank Marketing</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>- Model selection -</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.</li>
        <li>Classification Techniques: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, SVM.</li>
        <li>Resampling Methods: Cross-Validation, Bootstrapping.</li>
        <li>Deep Learning.</li>
        <li>Decision Trees and Random Forests.</li>
        <li>Unsupervised Learning: PCA and Clustering.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>- Final Project Report guidelines -</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preparing your data: Perform exploratory data analysis, identify goal/target features to predict, and preprocess the data as needed.</li>
        <li>Model selection: Apply at least two models (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, or Decision Trees) and justify your choices.</li>
        <li>Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, MSE, or R-squared to evaluate your models.</li>
        <li>Analysis: Summarize your findings, compare the performance of your models, and provide insights.</li>
        <li>Report: Submit a well-documented Jupyter Notebook following PEP 8 Style guidelines.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>- AI -</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are encouraged to use AI creatively. Please explain how and why AI was utilized in your project.</li>
        <li>The final project must not be entirely written by AI.</li>
    </ul>    

    <p>- Deliverables -</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A Jupyter Notebook containing your code, analysis, and results.</li>
        <li>A presentation of less than 10 minutes delivered during the Lab.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>- Deadlines -</p>
    <p>The presentation is due on March 11th. The report is due in the last week of class. Specific submission details will be announced closer to the deadline.</p>

    <p>- Grading rubric -</p>
    <ul>
        <li>50% Project Report.</li>
        <li>50% Presentation.</li>
    </ul>
